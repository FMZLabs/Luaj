/**
 * Global environment used by luaj.
 * <p>
 * Contains the global variables referenced by lua libraries such as stdin and stdout, 
 * the resrouce finder which is used tolook up files in a platform independent way, 
 * the installed lua compiler, the math library in use, debugging calls stack, and so on.  
 * <p>
 * In a multithreded server environment, each server thread should create one Globals instance, 
 * which will be logically distance and not interfere with each other, but share certain 
 * static immutable resources such as class data and string data.
 * <p>
 * Typically, this is constructed indirectly by a call to 
 * {@link JsePlatform.standardGlobasl()} or {@link JmePlatform.standardGlobals()},

 * Globals _G = JsePlatform.standardGlobals();
